	<h2>A web experience showcasing the broad work, broad products, and experience of Dennis Rumohr</h2>
	<p>Dennis Rumohr's Sanctuary will focus on sharing selected work, projects, and publications from Dennis Rumohr, with an emphasis on showcasing his work as a creative director and in other design leadership roles. The site will also be the primary marketing outlet for his future commodities and serve as a secondary promotion to his future website creations. Although not currently updating the site or the site being automatically updated, Dennis Rumohr's Sanctuary must be able to "switch" into a mode that communicates to visitors Dennis's daily thoughts or whatever news that he finds important.
