<h3>My Biography</h3>
<p> 
	I am a male from Michigan, United States. I have a very large diverse family and a feel like I can tell the story of my life for eternity. I am a white, 5â€™11 human being and I stand for helping for as long as I can. I have blonde hair and blue eyes. My birthday is October 7th, 1993 and I am a Libra. I was raised in the suburbs. I try to keep the bonds I make with people. I consider myself a Christian. I used to go to the Boys & Girls Club for about 13 years of my life. I have dreams and goals for my future and I never stop striving to have a fulfilling life.
	</p>I am a 5 and 1/2 year senior at Michigan State University, with hopes of this being my last semester. If I graduate it will be with a Bachelor's of science in Media and Information and a minor in I.T. On my journey, my first job was at the Boy's and Girl's club. I saved all the money I made from there and bought my first car, a Jeep Grand Cherokee Larado 1993 Burgandy. This is still the car I use today, 7 years later or so later. I then worked for my High school dictrict as a lifeguard and swim instructor. I kept that job for a while through college until I worked as a night time receptionist for the Brody complex halls doing night security. I later started working as a front desk receptionist too. A year or so later, I got a job at the MSU Kelogg Center giftshop. Later that summer, I got a job working on a golf course with my best friend. I then got a job at the MSU Veterinary Medicine College doing I.T. work. This was the first time that I believe I found the field of interest for my life. After working there for awhile I got an Internship in Detroit doing I.T. and database work and learned everything I needed to know. I now am at the end of my college career and I have everything I ever needed to have a successful future, but I need to finish or it means nothing.
