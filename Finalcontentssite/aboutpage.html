<h3 >My Life in Hindsight</h3>
<p>Growing up I never really thought about my life other than just living in the moment. Now that I am older I have been thinking about my life from the outside looking back for a long time now. It is funny because you never really think about consequences and what everything means when your younger. Once you get older you start to question who you were when you were younger and how it has made you who you are today. Personally, as a child I was very wierd and didn't care what anyone thought of me. I didn't really think there was a consequence to my actions because why should my actions have an effect on others. Now, being a 23 year old, I realize that most people get upset by others acting "wierd". With that being said, I've started to question why I was different and why I need to act "properly".</p>
<p>I think that being a foster child from the drug infested ghetto and raised in a family with 8 other foster brothers and sisters has a real large effect on who I am today. What I mean is, growing up, I never felt different than others and my situation didn't seem special or important what so ever. Some point along in my college career, reality started to hit hard and I really noticed differences in lifestyle between myself and others. I can tell now that without knowing my biological parents and my family situation being so complicated, my thought process is totally "backwards" from everyone elses. Especially now that I have hit "maturity" it seems that things have gotten every wierder for me and it seems like I am even more different than I ever thought. Most people are raised in a specific similar way and end up becoming a specific type of person. That majority is not me at all. The worst part is, that the majority have a problem with people who do not live like they do. It is as if they do not know how to empathize or they just do not care to or my reasonings don't matter to them because it has to be this way. Overall, looking back at my life, I do not see how anything could be any different because these are the cards I was dealt. My life in hindsight would really be defined as how much different everything seems once you get older.</p>

<h3 id="futureplan">My Future Plan</h3>
<p>My first step is to graduate. I usually plan everything out and try to figure out everything so that I am never lost. Lately, though, my brain has gotten so crowded that I have had to put everything to the side and just focus on one thing. More to come once I have my degree....</p>

<h3>My Struggles</h3>
<p>Right now a big struggle for me is money management. I feel like if I do not have a well secured future and present that I cannot be who I want to be without it. The problem with this mentality is that being "well secured" is a pretty subjective thought. I never really think of myself as a greedy person and if I had just enough to be safe and comfortable then that's good enough for me. On the other hand, maybe I will keep wanting more even once I get that ideal comfort from this stand point.</p><p>It seems like greed right now that I will spend money on a bunch of junk food and unnecessary entertainment instead of saving for my ideal comfort level, but I feel like it is just what I must do to be comfortable in the present without the rest. That is probably my biggest struggle. If I were to have to define what I feel would be comforable enough to be smart with my money then I would say a full small house with every niche filled with necessities, a fully function car, and a steady job. These things, to me right now, seem like they could keep me living smart. I know that once I get these things I am going to want more, but I think that I could control myself and just have plans for more, but only get them when financially acceptable.</p><p>My next struggle could be categorized in the same place as my money management mentioned above, and it is worrying. I think that really things are complicated for me and life is complicated as a whole. I do not know about the next guy, but I want to make the most of my life. I want to help people and I want to do everything I possibly can including spending moments and memories with people. The problem with all of this is that it keeps me worrying about what to do next and if I can do it or not. I drive myself crazy because it is the only way I can think. Like most things, it can be seen as a very bad thing and I can definitely see the problems with it, but I cannot stop. Overall, I would consider myself a Christian, a godly person, a believer in Jesus, and I just cannot live blindly because it seems so wrong to me. It seems like if I just giveup on the worrying that it is like selling my soul. I hope I find my breakthrough soon.
