	<h2>A web experience showcasing the design work, leadership, and publications of Dennis Rumohr</h2>
	<p>Rumohr.com will focus on sharing selected design work, projects, and publications from Dennis Rumohr, with an emphasis on showcasing his work as a creative director and in other design leadership roles. The site will also be the primary marketing outlet for his future commodities and serve as a secondary promotion to his future website creations. Although not currently focused on communicating his thoughts, Rumohr.com must be able to "switch" into a mode that communicates to visitors Dennis's daily thoughts or whatever news that he finds important.
