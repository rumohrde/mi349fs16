        <div class="column-center"><h1>Roast Chicken Vermentino</h1><img src="Roast-Chicken-Vermentino.jpg" alt="Roast-Chicken-Vermentino" /><h2>Preparation</h2>STEP 1 <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Bring 1 2/3 cups water to a simmer, and stir in the porcini; soak for 10 minutes. Drain, reserving both mushrooms and broth. Roughly chop the mushrooms.</p>
STEP 2 <p>Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add the garlic and cook until lightly browned. Add the mushrooms and saute for 2 minutes. Stir in the mushroom broth, bring to a boil and then simmer for about 10 minutes, so that it reduces by 1/3. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
STEP 3 <p>Trim off excess fat from the chicken pieces. Rinse and pat dry. Place the chicken, skin-side down, in one layer, in a large roasting pan. Tuck the potatoes and mushrooms around the chicken. Sprinkle with the rosemary, wine and remaining 3 tablespoons oil. Season with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven for 30 minutes. Turn the chicken over, season with more salt and pepper and continue cooking until the chicken and potatoes are lightly browned, 30 to 35 minutes more. Serve with the vegetables and the juices from the pan.</p><h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <div class="column-left"><h1 id="other2">Lamb</h1><img src="Lamb.jpg" alt="Lamb" /><h2>Preparation</h2>STEP 1<p>Combine parsley, mint, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, red chile flakes, salt and pepper. Rub half of the mixture over 2 pounds of lamb shoulder chops or chunks, and marinate overnight.</p>
STEP 2 <p>Heat a grill or broiler with the rack 4 to 6 inches from the flame. Wipe off the marinade; grill or broil, turning once, until medium, 4 or 5 minutes per side. Serve with the remaining chimichurri.</p><h3>Ingredients</h3><br>1 cup chopped parsley</br>
<br>1 cup chopped mint</br>
<br>¾ cup olive oil</br>
<br>¼ cup lemon juice</br>
<br>2 tablespoons minced garlic</br>
<br>2 teaspoons red chile flakes</br>

        <div class="column-right"><h1 id="other1">Squash Salad</h1><img src="Squash-salad.jpg" alt="Squash-salad" /><h2>Preparation</h2>STEP 1 <p>Put the currants in a small bowl, and pour the white-wine vinegar over them. Allow them to macerate for several hours or overnight, though in a pinch you can allow them to plump up while you prepare the squash. Heat oven to 450.</p>
STEP 2 <p>Cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, peel both halves (if you like: the skin of the kabocha squash is edible) and slice the squash into 1/4-inch half moons. Dress the squash lightly with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and season with the salt. Place the squash on a parchment-lined sheet pan, and roast until soft and caramelized, approximately 15 to 20 minutes, turning the pieces once or twice during the process. Remove the squash from the oven, and set aside to cool.</p>
STEP 3 <p>Meanwhile, in a medium-size bowl, combine the fennel seed, sumac and coriander, then add the parsley and cilantro, and stir to combine. Add 1/3 cup olive oil, and stir to combine. You want a wet mixture and may need to add a couple of extra tablespoons of oil to get it.</p>
STEP 4 <p>Drain the currants, reserving the vinegar, and add them to the green sauce. Add the lime juice, pistachios, cheese, 6 tablespoons olive oil and 5 teaspoons vinegar from the pickled currants to the green sauce. Taste, and add more lime juice or vinegar if you like, along with a spray of salt.</p>
STEP 5 <p>Place squash on a warm platter, and spoon the dressing over the top.</p><h3>Ingredients</h3><br>5 tablespoons dried currants</br>
<br>¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons white-wine vinegar</br>
<br>1 kabocha squash, approximately 3 to 4 pounds</br>
<br>Approximately 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</br>
<br>½ tablespoon kosher salt</br>
<br>1 tablespoon plus 3/4 teaspoon ground fennel seed</br>
<br>1 tablespoon plus 3/4 teaspoon ground sumac</br>
<br>1 tablespoon plus 3/4 teaspoon ground coriander</br>
<br>½ cup chopped parsley, packed</br>
<br>½ cup chopped cilantro, packed</br>
<br>¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice, approximately 3 to 4 limes</br>
<br>½ cup pistachios, toasted and chopped</br>
<br>½ cup firm feta cheese, diced</br><h4>Source</h4><a href="http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017892-housemans-roasted-squash-salad?action=click&module=Global+Search+Recipe+Card&pgType=search&rank=2" target=”_blank”>NICE link to Recipe3</a></div>
