This will be the heading of my first of two pages. I am kind of working blind here and going step by step instead of reading through everthing first. That seems like a better solution for me because I usually take the outside coming in approach and it just gets me lost.

<section class="classy">Here's a span with some text. This paragraph is going to be simple. This webpage consists of two pages and a navigation bar in which you can navigate between them both. I have added a "common" class attribute to both of the paragraphs in each page which just highlights the paragraphs. I also need to add a "unique" id to each of these pages. I do not know which I want to use the most. Frankly, I am looking at the requirements of this lab and I question the purpose. Is it just meant to show that we know how to reference the different selectors in css? If so, then I realize that classes use a period and ID's use a hashtag. Therefore, I have tried to use a common class with a span tag and then I will try to use two unique tags for the IDs.
